[RStudio](https://posit.co/products/open-source/rstudio/) provides a rich environment to work with R including a syntax-highlighting editor, integrated help and documentation, and interactive [literate programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literate_programming) through [R Notebooks](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/notebook.html).

We make extensive use of [R Markdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/) documents for preparation assignments, workshop sessions, and preparing reproducible reports.
